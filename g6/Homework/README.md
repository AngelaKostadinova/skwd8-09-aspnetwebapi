# Todo application

### Requirements
We want to create a TODO application, we have the client that will consume the data we only need service that will process that data. 

### Bonus
Research and collaborate as a team, every question that you will have first consult with the team and if you need more clarification create a text file that will contain most of the question and suggestions and send that file to Tosho or Trajan to clarify. 
Also you will be given the freedom to create your own tasks so that every project will be unique on its own way.
Every team member should create his own MVP application. 
As a clarification by the term Team i mean the whole group should collaborate for creating the task and question regarding the application.

### Tips and tricks
Be creative and overengineer stuff
