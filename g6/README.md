# ASP.NET WebAPI ðŸ“•
**This subject is focused on the ASP.NET framework again, but on a different type of application, an API application. Throughout this subject, we would combine all the knowledge of the previous subjects and build a dynamic Web API. It is required to have a basic understanding of the ASP.NET Framework, Entity Framework basics, C# core features, and SQL basics. With that in mind we will learn:**
* How to create and implement ASP.NET WebAPI projects
* How to handle requests through an API web application
* How to communicate with the database with different frameworks
* How HTTP communication works
* How to secure an API web application
* How to build an end-to-end WebAPI solution
